You changed something in the compiler and you need to know whether it got
better or worse. This runs GUI agents and compiled OpenAdapt workflows against
a benchmark, scores them with the benchmark's own verifier instead of asking
the agent how it did, provisions the VMs that takes, and writes the numbers to
a file you can commit.

It's for people working on OpenAdapt, and for anyone who wants to measure a GUI
agent against [Windows Agent Arena](https://microsoft.github.io/WindowsAgentArena/).
You don't need it to record or replay a workflow, which is
[openadapt-flow](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-flow).

## Try it without a VM

```bash
pip install openadapt-evals
openadapt-evals mock --tasks 5
```

```
11:24:42 [INFO] Task 5/5: mock_file_explorer_001
11:24:42 [INFO] Step 0: Agent chose action: click
11:24:42 [INFO] Step 1: Agent signaled task completion
11:24:42 [INFO] [SUCCESS] Task mock_file_explorer_001 completed successfully (score: 1.00)
11:24:42 [INFO] Saved summary: 5/5 outcomes succeeded (100.0%); 0 errors across 5 attempts

==================================================
Evaluation Results
==================================================
Attempts:     5
Outcomes:     5
Errors:       0
Success rate: 100.0% (outcomes only)
Avg score:    1.000 (outcomes only)
Avg steps:    1.0 (all attempts)
```

Abridged output from 0.94.0. The mock adapter and its deterministic agent both
always succeed, so 100% here means the harness is wired up, and nothing else.
Every other command in this repository can cost money.

## Price a real run before you pay for it

`openadapt-eval-flow` is dry-run unless you pass `--live`. Dry runs provision
nothing, start no VM, and make no network calls:

```bash
openadapt-eval-flow --mode replay --tasks 154 --dry-run
```

```
  154 tasks:
    Azure VM-hours:        2.82 vm-hours @ $0.19/hr  = $0.54
    Agent token cost:      $0.00  (paid tasks=0.0, 0 steps each)
    -> TOTAL:              $0.54   ($0.0035/task)
    Pure-agent baseline:   $39.06   (22 steps/task, all paid)
    Savings vs baseline:   $38.53

  HARD GUARDRAILS (enforced on any --live paid run):
    per-run cap:      $0.50
    total cap:        $5.00
    per-task tokens:  60,000
    billing-abort:    after 2 consecutive errors
```

Those caps aren't decoration. An early uncapped run cost real money, which is
how they got there.

## Drive it from Python

```python
from openadapt_evals import (
    ApiAgent, WAALiveAdapter, WAALiveConfig,
    evaluate_agent_on_benchmark, compute_metrics,
)

adapter = WAALiveAdapter(WAALiveConfig(server_url="http://localhost:5001"))
agent = ApiAgent(provider="anthropic")

results = evaluate_agent_on_benchmark(agent, adapter, task_ids=["notepad_1"])
print(f"Success rate: {compute_metrics(results)['success_rate']:.1%}")
```

## Run against a live WAA server

```bash
oa-vm pool-create --workers 1        # or --cloud aws
oa-vm pool-wait --qualification-dir ./proofs
openadapt-evals run --agent api-claude --task notepad_1
openadapt-evals view --run-name live_eval
oa-vm pool-cleanup -y                # stops billing
```

Forget the last line and the VM bills until you remember. `pool-wait`,
`pool-run`, and `pool-auto` require `--qualification-dir`, a directory holding
a fresh `<worker>.identity.json` and `<worker>.egress.json` for each worker;
they refuse to run without it. Most pool commands take `--cloud azure`
(the default) or `--cloud aws`, though `pool-logs`, `pool-vnc`, and `pool-exec`
do not. The rest of the `oa-vm`
subcommands, the `oa` and `openadapt-evals` command tables, and the
configuration and AWS SSO setup are in [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

## What the current evidence says

Every published report pins one exact `openadapt-flow` wheel, so a Flow release
can invalidate a report without a single commit landing here.
`docs/eval_results/PUBLISHED_EVIDENCE.json` records which set is current and
which release it was measured against, and
`scripts/check_published_evidence_freshness.py` fails when that pin drifts. It
runs offline on every pull request and against PyPI on a daily schedule.

The current set is `current_flow_v1_33_0_local_20260826`, measured 2026-08-26
against Flow 1.33.0 on macOS with headless Chromium. One synthetic MockMed
workflow, three arms, three runs each:

| Condition | Compiled replay | DOM positional | DOM name-scoped |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clean` | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| `theme` | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| `rename` | 3/3 | 0/3 | 0/3 |

The `rename` row is the one worth reading. It changes `Open` to `View` and
`Save Encounter` to `Submit Encounter`, and both Playwright selector controls
failed loudly at the first renamed locator before mutating anything. Those are
unsupported-drift halts, not silent wrong writes. Compiled replay is also
roughly thirty times slower per run than a working selector, 6.9s against
0.21s, which is the honest reminder that structural actuation should stay the
preferred tier wherever an application gives you one.

Zero silent incorrect successes, zero wrong actions, zero over-halts, zero
model calls, $0.00 across all 27 runs. Full report, caveats, and the dependency
freeze: [`docs/eval_results/current_flow_v1_33_0_local_20260826/`](docs/eval_results/current_flow_v1_33_0_local_20260826/).

Publish a new set rather than editing an old one. Superseded reports stay
reproducible against the wheel they were measured on, and none of the eight get
deleted.

## What this repository cannot tell you yet

- **There is no current Flow-versus-zero-shot number.** The word `current` on an
  evidence set means release-fresh, not production-accepted. No Azure WAA VM was
  started for the 1.33.0 set and no model was called.
- **The live WAA path is not finished.** `scripts/eval_flow_on_waa.py` leaves
  `WAALiveAdapter.evaluate` unwired on the replay path, so it cannot
  independently score success, and the hybrid live path returns before
  execution because its adapter isn't connected either. Wiring both is step one
  of any valid comparison run.
- **The evidence is local and synthetic.** Bundled MockMed, one workflow, one
  macOS host. No hosted lifecycle, no Windows UIA, no RDP, no Citrix, and no
  real customer application is represented anywhere in it.
- **Only two benchmark families exist.** `BenchmarkAdapter` is built to extend
  to OSWorld or WebArena. Today there is WAA, live and mock, and there is
  `LocalAdapter` for native desktop runs.
- **Some of it is deliberately absent.** Deployment-derived thresholds, tuned
  adversary parameters, per-system-of-record oracle recipes, and real customer
  datasets stay out of this open repository.

The missing acceptance tracks and the exit condition for each are written down
in [docs/eval_results/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md](docs/eval_results/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md).

## What else is in here

A meta-benchmark harness runs record, compile, replay, heal, verify across any
registered `Environment` and emits one metrics row per `(env, task, mode)`, and
exports to [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/). Thirteen agents ship,
including a dual-model `PlannerGrounderAgent` that separates what to do from
where to click, and a `ScrubMiddleware` strips PII before any agent sees a
screenshot. There's also a standalone GRPO trainer with no openadapt-ml
dependency, an OpenEnv-compatible environment, and a four-pass pipeline that
turns desktop recordings into structured workflows.

Runbooks for the demo-conditioned eval, the full evaluation runner, the UI-Venus
grounder endpoint, GRPO training, and writing your own agent are in
[docs/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/WORKFLOWS.md), along with the package tree.

This is research infrastructure and it moves fast. Branches and pull requests
only, never a direct push to `main`. PR titles need
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format, because
`python-semantic-release` parses them to decide the version bump.
[CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-evals/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)
has the development conventions and the WAA benchmark workflow.
