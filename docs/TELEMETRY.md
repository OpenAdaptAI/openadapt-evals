# Telemetry

OpenAdapt collects anonymous usage telemetry to understand how the tools are used and prioritize development. No screenshots, text content, API keys, or personally identifiable information is ever collected.

## Disabling telemetry

Add one line to your `.env` file:

```env
DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

That's it. All telemetry is disabled globally — no events are sent, no background threads are started, no network connections are made.

This works across all OpenAdapt packages (openadapt-evals, openadapt-ml, openadapt-capture) because they all check this variable before sending any data.

### Alternative

```env
OPENADAPT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

Both `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` and `OPENADAPT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` have the same effect. `DO_NOT_TRACK` follows the [Console Do Not Track](https://consoledonottrack.com/) standard used by Homebrew, Gatsby, Next.js, and other OSS projects.

### Environment variable (no .env file)

```bash
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

Or per-command:

```bash
DO_NOT_TRACK=1 python scripts/train_trl_grpo.py --task-dir tasks/ ...
```

## What we collect

When telemetry is enabled, we collect:

- **Event counts**: how many training runs, agent episodes, demos recorded
- **Timing**: how long operations take (not wall-clock timestamps)
- **Package metadata**: package version, Python version, OS (no hostname or IP)
- **Training metrics**: reward mean, loss value, gradient norm (no model weights or training data)

We do **not** collect:

- Screenshots or images
- Text content, prompts, or model outputs
- API keys, passwords, or credentials
- File paths with usernames
- IP addresses or hostnames
- Any data that could identify a person or organization

## How it works

Telemetry events are sent to [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) via a background thread. Events are batched and sent asynchronously — telemetry never blocks your training or evaluation. If the network is unavailable, events are silently dropped.

The telemetry client generates a random anonymous ID stored locally at `~/.openadapt/telemetry_distinct_id`. This ID is not linked to any personal information.

## Automatic scrubbing

Even if telemetry is enabled, a privacy scrubber automatically removes:

- Email addresses and phone numbers (pattern-matched)
- API keys and tokens (key name detection)
- File paths containing usernames (sanitized to `~`)
- Any field named `password`, `token`, `secret`, `api_key`, etc.

## CI environments

Telemetry is automatically disabled in CI environments unless explicitly enabled:

```bash
OPENADAPT_TELEMETRY_IN_CI=true  # opt-in for CI
```
