"""Receipt consumption shared by the TRL and verl adapters.

reward endpoint, how a receipt is fetched, how a receipt becomes a scored
episode, and how unscored episodes are removed from a GRPO group.

scoring rules; it calls ``score()`` and reads the receipt's own fields, then
refuses the combinations a trainer must never accept.
