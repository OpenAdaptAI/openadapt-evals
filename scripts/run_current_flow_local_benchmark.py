"""Run a source-bound, local-only benchmark of current compiled Flow.

The benchmark intentionally avoids paid models and provider infrastructure. It
records and compiles the bundled synthetic MockMed workflow, then compares:

* OpenAdapt compiled replay;
* a positional Playwright selector script; and
* a name-scoped Playwright selector script.

Every arm gets a fresh browser and is judged by the same screenshot/OCR oracle:
the expected saved encounter, exact note, and intended patient must be visible,
and a wrong-type or wrong-patient write is a wrong action.  Neither the
replayer nor either script can self-score success.

The default matrix has three trials per arm in each of three conditions:
clean, cosmetic theme drift, and user-facing label drift.  Healthy runs make no
model calls and no network/provider calls beyond loopback to the bundled app.
