"""Probe the two safety properties of Flow 1.28.0's remote frame-lease delivery.

openadapt-flow ``c9618cc`` (released in 1.28.0) changed how a *consequential*
remote pointer edge is delivered.  Before it, such a step required
``GuardedRemotePointerActionBackend`` -- the backend that returns an explicit
typed, target-bound delivery receipt -- so every opaque remote surface that can
offer only the documented one-shot actuation lease (the no-DOM HTML5-canvas
class Citrix Workspace-web presents) halted on its write step.  After it, the
runtime delivers through the lease when no typed receipt exists.

Relaxing a refusal is exactly the kind of change that can buy a green
demonstration with a silent wrong write, so the release note's two claims are
measured here rather than trusted:

1. **A governed run still refuses.**  Under a ``GovernedRunAuthorization``
   (Standard/Regulated), a consequential remote click on a backend that cannot
   bind its exact fresh frame and target to delivery must stop *before the first
   input edge*.
2. **The lease-delivered result is never a production success.**  It carries no
   ``actuation`` tier and no ``delivery_receipt``, so Flow's own outcome
   classifier must map it to ``COMPLETED_UNVERIFIED`` and never to ``VERIFIED``,
   under every execution profile.

A third cell measures the property the change relies on: the lease itself.  A
remote frame that changes between ``acquire_actuation_frame`` and the input edge
must abort delivery, otherwise "the lease is the safety property" is not true.

Method matches the sibling runners in this directory: the exact published wheel
is extracted and imported from that extraction, the wheel is bound to
release-tagged tracked-clean source, ``>=3`` trials per cell, no retries, no
model calls, no network access, and every invariant is reported with the
denominator it was evaluated over.  A violated invariant is counted and (unless
``--no-fail-on-violation``) exits non-zero.  It is never silently downgraded.

The backend here is a fake: it implements only the two-phase remote actuation
lease, which is the exact protocol surface a pixel-only canvas backend exposes.
That is deliberate -- the question is what the *runtime* does when a backend can
offer nothing more, and a fake is the only way to hold everything else constant.
This probe therefore measures a runtime contract, not a real remote session.
