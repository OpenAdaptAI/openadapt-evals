"""Probe Flow's transaction outcome taxonomy against a real persistence boundary.

This extends ``run_current_flow_local_benchmark.py`` (which measures compiled
replay against selector controls) with the question that benchmark cannot ask:
when a consequential write meets a *backend* fault, what does the runtime say it
knows about the business effect?

Flow >= 1.21 refines the coarse ``execution_outcome`` into a terminal
:class:`~openadapt_flow.transaction.TransactionOutcome` -- ``VERIFIED`` /
``HALTED_BEFORE_EFFECT`` / ``RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`` / ``FAILED_PLATFORM`` /
``COMPLETED_UNVERIFIED`` / ``CANCELED`` / ``REJECTED_POLICY`` / ``ROLLED_BACK``
-- plus a per-step effect journal.  Those labels are *claims about the system of
record*, so they must be judged against the system of record, never against the
runtime's own report or the screen.

The bundled MockMed ``fault_server`` provides exactly that: it serves the same
static app but adds a real persistence boundary with an in-process store that
``GET /api/db`` exposes as independent ground truth.  Each ``?fault=`` mode
reproduces a named consequential-write failure:

* ``ok``          -- the write is persisted normally (control).
* ``timeout``     -- the server COMMITS the row, then hangs past the client
                     timeout.  The client sees an error though the write landed:
                     this is the uncertain-delivery case.
* ``optimistic``  -- the server REJECTS the write after the app already painted
                     a success banner.  The screen lies; nothing is persisted.
* ``session``     -- the write returns 401; nothing is persisted.
* ``duplicate``   -- every arriving write is accepted, so a double-delivered
                     click writes TWO rows.

Every fault mode is run under two configurations, because the taxonomy's
guarantee is only as good as what was actually verified:

* ``unverified``      -- the stock compiled bundle, no effect verifier (what a
                         user gets by default).
* ``effect_verified`` -- the same bundle with the consequential save step
                         carrying a ``record_written`` + ``field_equals``
                         contract, checked by ``RestRecordVerifier`` against the
                         system of record.

Methodology matches the sibling benchmark: no retries, ``>=3`` trials per cell,
one arm-independent oracle shared by every cell, and healthy runs make no model
calls and no network calls beyond loopback.

The invariants in :func:`evaluate_invariants` are the point of this script.  A
violated invariant is reported, counted, and (unless ``--no-fail-on-violation``)
exits non-zero.  It is never silently downgraded.
